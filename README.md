# Falcor (fork)

This repository implements some Computer Graphics projects as Render Passes using the Falcor framework.

If you are unfamiliar with Falcor, please look through the [original readme](README-original.md). To run a project, build Falcor (as outlined in the original README) and start Mogwai. Each project will have a Render Graph Script that Mogwai can load, which you can find under [scripts](scripts/). Scenes are automatically downloaded when you setup Falcor, but the original README also links to more scenes you can manually download.
